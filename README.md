# AnimationAttemptinSpline
I attempted to make an animation with this honey bear and a small drop within spline, using the systems animation tools. (this project is a work in progress and will be continuaully updates with new branches as more developments are made)

## Overview
The task was to create a simiple animation using Spline, I really am struggling with the concept of 3D modeling finding myself longing to physically touch something like clay that I have actual control over. I chose to make a simple scupture of a bear turned honey bear container that has a single drop coming out. I was unfortunatly unable to get the actual animation to work with the program saying that the component needed to be place in "the scene" which is highly confusing, I will continue to work with the program till I can get it to work. 

## Users
The user of this is just me and perhaps other people who like the honey bear. 

## Learnings 
I learned that the object has to go in the scene in order to animat, what that scene is, is still more of a mystery but as I work through things and go through the Spline tutorial today I am sure I will learn more.
